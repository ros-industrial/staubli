[ROS-Industrial][] Staubli meta-package. See the [ROS wiki][] page for more information.

The [staubli_experimental][] repository contains additional packages.


## Contents

Branch naming follows the ROS distribution they are compatible with. `-devel` branches may be unstable. Releases are made from distribution branches (`hydro`, `indigo`, `kinetic`).


## Building

### On newer (or older) versions of ROS

Building the packages on newer (or older) versions of ROS is in most cases possible and supported. For example: building the packages in this repository on Ubuntu Xenial/ROS Kinetic or Ubuntu Bionic/ROS Melodic systems is supported. This will require creating a Catkin workspace, cloning this repository, installing all required dependencies and finally building the workspace.

### Catkin tools

It is recommended to use [catkin_tools][] instead of the default [catkin][] when building ROS workspaces. `catkin_tools` provides a number of benefits over regular `catkin_make` and will be used in the instructions below. All packages can be built using `catkin_make` however: use `catkin_make` in place of `catkin build` where appropriate.

### Building the packages

The following instructions assume that a [Catkin workspace][] has been created at `$HOME/catkin_ws` and that the *source space* is at `$HOME/catkin_ws/src`. Update paths appropriately if they are different on the build machine.

These instructions build the `indigo-devel` branch on a ROS Kinetic system:

```bash
# change to the root of the Catkin workspace
$ cd $HOME/catkin_ws

# retrieve the latest development version of staubli.
$ git clone -b indigo-devel https://github.com/ros-industrial/staubli.git src/staubli

# check build dependencies. Note: this may install additional packages,
# depending on the software installed on the machine
$ rosdep update

# be sure to change 'kinetic' to whichever ROS release you are using
$ rosdep install --from-paths src/ --ignore-src --rosdistro kinetic

# build the workspace (using catkin_tools)
$ catkin build
```

### Activating the workspace

Finally, activate the workspace to get access to the packages just built:

```bash
$ source $HOME/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash
```

At this point all packages should be usable (ie: `roslaunch` should be able to auto-complete package names starting with `staubli_..`). In case the workspace contains additional packages (ie: not from this repository), those should also still be available.


## Installation and usage

Refer to [Working With ROS-Industrial Robot Support Packages][] for information on how to use the files provided by the robot support and MoveIt configuration packages. See also the other pages on the [ROS wiki][].
